GPIO0     -> H - Start Up, L - Flash, should have 10K pull up resistor
GPIO1(TX) -> L, H, Input by default, Controls the blue LED (on when low, off when high). At the start it is always an output for a short time, so use 330 Ohms resistor between this pin and the input
GPIO2     -> H - Start Up - should have 10K pull up resistor when used as output. It is tough to use this pin as input
GPIO3(RX) -> L, H, Output by default

GPIO0 and GPIO2 need to have pull-up resistors for normal startup if they are used as Inputs



GPIO1 - input
GPIO3 - input
GPIO2 - output with pull up resistor
